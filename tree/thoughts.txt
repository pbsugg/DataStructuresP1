Pseudo for adding a new element to an ordered tree

Still going to try to do this in a pre-order traversal.  Even if the data structure doesn't *look* like it's in order on the map, if it always comes out in a consistent fashion then I am in good shape.



Pseudo:

Input: Queue, element_to_add
Output: Tree with new element inserted


  Convert Tree to Queue (Level Order Traversal of tree)

  Evaluate where new element falls by popping from Queue1 to Queue2
    dequeue element1, put in holder
    dequeue element 2, put in second holder
    WHILE Queue1.peel != nil
      element1 == Queue1.dequeue
    IF element_to_add is >= element1
      insert element_to_add
      insert element1 to Queue2
    ELSE
      insert element1 to Queue2
    END

Convert Queue2 back to tree
  (will still have to do this using a level-order traversal)
