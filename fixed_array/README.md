TD: Implement Tests (has been tested practically through use by higher-level data structures)

Model of a fixed array.  Uses the Ruby "Array" method but interface treats it as a fixed array which cannot be dynamically resized.  No advanced built-in Ruby methods used on array.  Methods include:

  '#initialize(size)': with instance attributes for size and space

  '#set(index, element)': set array at index to element

  'get(index)': get element at index
