# Overview #
Models of some important data structures to practice algorithms and understand their advantages and disadvantages.  With a few exceptions, these are built in Ruby, and the methods for each data structure are inspired by the DBC "Phase 4" curriculum written by [Matt Baker](https://github.com/mattbaker).

# Purpose #

The emphasis here is on inter-operability between data structures, and on understanding the connections between lower-level structures (eg., fixed array, linked lists) and the higher-level structures (e.g, dynamic arrays, queues, etc.) that rely on them in their underlying functionality.  With a few very small exceptions that do not affect the essential difficulty of each challenge, I have not used any built-in Ruby methods.  I also emphasize good principles of object-oriented design (e.g., flexible, limited interfaces beween classes, duck typing), and rely extensively on testing to ensure that each data structure functions as intended.
